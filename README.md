# Expresion dataset analysis (EDA)

Properties of GeneSPIDER synthetic data compared to real data.
Project that aims at comparing gene spider generated data to real data (most likely L1000 data).
OBS The tool have been built primarily with the GS data in mind and therefore focuses heavily on invertability

Further note that the project is partyl finished and likely will stay as a partly finished project for some time to come. 

For the HTML writing I took a lot of inspiration from here:
